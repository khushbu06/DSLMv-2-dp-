## [Design Science modules](https://khushbu06.github.io/TrialversionDSLM/) is a place to learn about and create Design Principles

The (wip) project is managed by [Ben Brignell](https://twitter.com/benbrignell) an independent product designer from London.

If you or your organisation want to book a one or two-day workshop to help your team write Design Principles then [please get in touch](https://brignell.uk).

### What are Design Principles?

[Take a look at our brief explanation about what Design Principles are](https://principles.design#what-are-design-principles) and what value they have. If you prefer to learn by example there's plenty of real-life examples on the [examples page](/examples).

### What's next?
The aim of the site is to help us analyse what good Design Principles are. How Design Principles are created and measured. How they develop. Design Principles should be improved over time, how can we build a history of Design Principles and their improvements?

There are still a few more things to come which are listed on the [roadmap](https://github.com/benbrignell/design-principles/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aroadmap).

Feedback and suggestions welcome!
